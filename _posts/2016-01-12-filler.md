title: Random prize selection based on frequencies in Unity3D C#
---

This post will just let you know how you can create a controlled random selection script that you can use in some gambling games like spinning wheel.

Initialize the variables 
In my case I am creating 4 variables for 4 prizes.
We will add it the range attribute so we get that sexy slider option in the inspector.

<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
 [Range(0,10)]
    public int prize1,prize2,prize3,prize4;
</pre>

Then I am creating a temporary list of int to do something I will tell you in the next steps.

<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
    List<int> prizeList = new List<int>();
</pre>
