I am working on an IT company as a full time video game developer.\r\nI am recently taking interest in [Editor Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExtendingTheEditor.html) that will take a little time to write the code and then saves a lot of your time and you can focus on the main part of the project.\r\n\r\nI like to share my work and my codes for free I haven't shared any of my developed games source code because of my current company's policy.\r\n\r\nI will share my games[with source code] if I develop some in my free time. And I also know some of the [Scriptable Objects](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMe and my friends Harshit (@notrorschach) and [Sreejit](https://www.facebook.com/PillaiSreejit) work together in a IT company as game developers.\r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nIf you get stuck with my code or want to follow up you can follow me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_prashantsingh_) or email me on [hi@prashantsingh.xyz](mailto:hi@prashantsingh.xyz?Subject=From%20Github).\r\n\r\nPeace!",
